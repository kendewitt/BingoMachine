# BingoMachine

If you teach children's English lessons in Japan, you know how much kids like bingo. But creating a bunch of bingo cards and making sure they're random is a time consuming pain in the ass. That's why I sat down one week and decided to do something about it.

BingoMachine will take some images that you put in a folder on your Mac and arrange them randomly on as many bingo cards as you need.

# Dependencies
PIL

Python 3 of course

# Usage

1. Put the BingoMachine.py in a folder, along with another folder named "BingoItems".
2. Download the images you need to the "BingoItems" folder.
3. Open Terminal on your Mac, CD to the folder you put BingoMachine.py in, and run python3 BingoMachine.py (You're going to have to have Python 3 installed already, of course. And you'll have to figure that out on your own.)
4. Follow the prompts in the terminal.
